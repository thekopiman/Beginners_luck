                            <p>At Zalora, we operate in a fast-paced environment, so it won’t be a stroll in the park and 
                                there will be plenty of challenging work in parallel. Working with a mentor in the Growth Hacking squad,
                                 you can expect to be stretched to deliver quality work with relatively short turnaround time, take 
                                 ownership of your deliverable, and also an abundance of learning, especially on the best practices and
                                  tools to experimentation at scale.</p>
